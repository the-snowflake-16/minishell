## 🚀 About the Project
MiniShell is a **Unix shell recreation** built as part of the 42 Prague curriculum. This project aims to deepen the understanding of **processes, pipes, signals, and terminal manipulation** while implementing a functional command-line interpreter.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Command execution (ls, echo, pwd, etc.)  
✅ Environment variables handling (`export`, `unset`, etc.)  
✅ Input/output redirections (`>`, `<`, `>>`)  
✅ Pipes (`|`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`)  
✅ Built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`, `env`, `export`, `unset`)  
✅ Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+Z`)
